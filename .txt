Create an ec2 instance

Update machine

We need Java installer (java setup )

sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y

Visit this site 
https://pkg.jenkins.io/
Then select debian-stable/
This will give you a guide and commands to install Jenkins

We have successfully installed Jenkins
To start the jenkins server

sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins

sudo systemctl enable jenkins  (to check status)

By default Jenkins occupy 8080 port 

So copy public ip of your instance and type
link:8080

Also in your Security Group  (in incoming), you must add a custom TCP port with an 8080 port number and 0.0.0.0/0 rule
After connecting to public ip:8080

It will provide a path
Copy the path in instance and type

sudo cat (path)
It will generate a key for your Jenkins server

Paste the key in the running server and proceed toward complete installation of Jenkins
After all authentications (name, password, email, etc) 
You are now on the Jenkins dashboard 

Ready to use Jenkins
